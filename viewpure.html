I wondered: did anyone else share this need? If not, did people need anything similar?</p><p>I spent a few weeks figuring this out, asking friends, teachers, adults, "internet friends" whom I had met over online forums I frequented at the time. </p><p>What don't you like about watching videos on YouTube? What would you change, if you could? Do you ever have trouble showing videos in classrooms / at work / to your pre-loss-of-innocence-aged kids?</p><p>As it turned out, people did desire such a tool. But the focus wasn't on the individual viewing experience: it was on <span class="highlight">the video sharing experience</span>.</p><h3>Brainstorm &amp; prototype</h3><p>I began jotting down ideas in my 70-page Mead notebook.</p><p>What did I want? Above all, I wanted to share videos without inappropriate content. Then I wanted the ability to customize the experience by, say, having a black background. Easily memorable custom URLs.</p><p>What did others want? A quick way to share and show videos, and in such a way <span class="highlight">that wouldn't add unneeded friction to their existing workflow</span>.</p><p>I built out the first prototype in a few days on the then-in-vogue PHP &amp; MySQL stack. It had these features:</p><ul><li><span class="bold">Drag-and-drop bookmarklet</span> that would redirect users from the YouTube page to the "purified" version on ViewPure.</li><li><span class="bold">Parallel URL structure</span> such that changing the host of the YouTube URL would show the corresponding video on ViewPure (i.e. youtube.com/watch?v=_JmA2ClUvUY vs. viewpure.com/_JmA2ClUvUY).</li><li><span class="bold">Simple text field</span> on homepage that took a YouTube URL, automatically stripped out the ID, and generated the ViewPure-equivalent URL.</li><li><span class="bold">Minimal onboarding instructions</span>.</li></ul><div class="fake-browser-wrap text-center"><div class="fake-browser large margined has-caption"><div class="nav"><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div><div class="frame"><video src="media/cases/viewpure/page/viewpure_v0_main.mp4" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop"></video></div><div class="fb-caption italic text-center">Yes, I recreated it, which explains 2018-style YT embed instead of Flash</div></div></div><h3>Initial version</h3><p>I released it sometime in March of 2010, installed Google Analytics for more granular user data collection and <a href="https://clicky.com/" target="_blank">Clicky</a> for live updates, posted it to a few subreddits and HackerRank type websites, and let it do its thing.</p><p>I didn't expect many users besides family members, myself, and perhaps a few internet strangers, so for the first few months I didn't really keep a close eye on the analytics.</p><p>Then in June of 2010 &mdash; I was with my family at the Tokyo Narita airport, waiting for our connection to Taipei &mdash; I suddenly started receiving downtime notifications.</p><p>I opened my Clicky analytics panel to see over <span class="highlight">16,000 unique visitors</span> in that day alone. It had been featured on a few technology blogs, and its popularity had skyrocketed.</p><h3>Incorporate feedback</h3><p>From that point on, I began scouring Reddit, Twitter, and education blogs for feature requests and implemented them on a rapid release cycle (I didn't call it that then; I just pushed an update whenever a feature was finished).</p><p>Features I later added:</p><ul><li><span class="bold">Dark mode</span> gave the ability for users to watch with a dark background.</li><li><span class="bold">Custom URLs</span> were a popular requests (and the feature I personally used the most). It allowed users to create user-readable links such as viewpure.com/BabiesArguing.</li><li><span class="bold">Start and end time</span> that allowed users to create ViewPure links that had preset start and end times for videos (I realize, mid-writing, how self-explanatory this must be).</li><li><span class="bold">Custom aspect ratios</span> to allow users to switch between 16:9 and 4:3. This was in an era when YouTube videos were still oddly 4:3.</li><li><span class="bold">Password protection</span>, along with custom URLs, were the most requested features. It allowed users to lock a ViewPure page with a password (good for sharing custom links linking to unlisted YouTube videos).</li></ul><div class="fake-browser-wrap text-center"><div class="fake-browser large margined has-caption"><div class="nav"><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div><div class="frame"><video src="media/cases/viewpure/page/viewpure_v1_main.mp4" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop"></video></div><div class="fb-caption italic text-center">After incorporating a lot of user-requested features</div></div></div><h3>Capturing the full funnel: search</h3><p>After a few months, I realized that ViewPure was most commonly used via the bookmarklet, meaning users still had to go to YouTube first beforehand in order to reach a purified version of the video.</p><p>This was problematic because some users would forget to search the video beforehand, and then, in the case of teachers, have to navigate (with great risk, might I add) the sea of YouTube search results where a innocuous search term such as "banana" could reveal the greatest depths of human depravity.</p><p>As a result, <span class="highlight">I implemented a barebones search functionality</span> that allowed users to search straight from ViewPure.</p><div class="fake-browser-wrap text-center"><div class="fake-browser large margined has-caption"><div class="nav"><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div><div class="frame"><img src="media/cases/viewpure/page/viewpure_v1_search.png" alt="Search page, without search results"/></div><div class="fb-caption italic text-center">Search page, without search results</div></div></div><p>This continued to be one of the most visited pages on ViewPure, and soon allowed for ViewPure to become more than just a video page, but a platform of sorts.</p><h3>Adding delight: live feed</h3><p>In addition to the search page, I added a fun "Live" page that would update with videos people were watching (with password-protected videos stripped out, of course). It didn't add a huge amount of utility, <span class="italics">per se</span>, but it made the website feel "alive," like there was activity constantly pulsing in the background.</p><div class="fake-browser-wrap text-center"><div class="fake-browser large margined has-caption"><div class="nav"><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div><div class="frame"><img src="media/cases/viewpure/page/viewpure_v1_live.png" alt="Live feed that refreshed with videos people were currently watching"/></div><div class="fb-caption italic text-center">Live feed that refreshed with videos people were currently watching</div></div></div><p>This was then monetized with relative success.</p><div class="fake-browser-wrap text-center"><div class="fake-browser large margined has-caption"><div class="nav"><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div><div class="frame"><video src="media/cases/viewpure/page/viewpure_v1_ads.mp4" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop"></video></div><div class="fb-caption italic text-center">Panel to purchase advertisement slots on Live page</div></div></div><h3>Major redesign &amp; the omnibox</h3><p>In 2014, I began working on a Version 2. My plans for the update were twofold: a rewrite of the existing codebase to be cleaner and more modular, and an overhaul of the design.</p><p>The focus of the redesign was <span class="highlight">hinged on the idea of the "omnibox"</span>, the "one text field to rule them all" approach that Chrome had adopted early on for its address bar. This pattern had become so popular that many (many) visitors to ViewPure were entering search terms instead of YouTube URLs, naturally leading them to error states.</p><p>It seemed clear to pivot to this "omnibox" approach: <span class="highlight">it was clean, effective, and, most importantly, simplified the UX without introducing a huge mental model shift for long-time ViewPure users</span>.</p><p>In the final design, there is one single text field, enlarged for emphasis, and it takes both URLs and search texts. The query is passed through a regex comparison to see if it could be a YouTube URL, and if it is, a request is then made via the YouTube API to verify the video's existence. Otherwise, the user is forwarded to the ViewPure search results page.</p><div class="fake-browser-wrap text-center"><div class="fake-browser large margined has-caption"><div class="nav"><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div><div class="frame"><img src="media/cases/viewpure/page/redesign.png" alt="Redesign of ViewPure in 2014, with the omnibox"/></div><div class="fb-caption italic text-center">Redesign of ViewPure in 2014, with the omnibox</div></div></div></div></div></section><!-- Outcome.--><section class="large-text text-left light-bg" id="outcome-section"><div class="container"><h2 class="section-title animated fadeInUp wow" id="outcome">Outcome</h2><div class="pure-g"><div class="pure-u-1-3 text-center mb-u-1-1"><div class="figure animated fadeInUpSmall wow"><div class="number">2.3M</div>Monthly Pageviews</div></div><div class="pure-u-1-3 text-center mb-u-1-1"><div class="figure animated fadeInUpSmall wow"><div class="number">1.73M</div>Monthly Unique Views</div></div><div class="pure-u-1-3 text-center mb-u-1-1"><div class="figure animated fadeInUpSmall wow"><div class="number">60K</div>Peak Alexa Rank</div></div></div><div class="pure-g interlude animated fadeInUpSmall wow"><div class="word-col text-left horizontal-center"><div class="xl-text text-center"><p>There is a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=viewpure" target="_blank">constant stream of tweets</a> talking about ViewPure and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=viewpure" target="_blank">pages upon pages</a> of user-uploaded YouTube tutorials.</p></div></div></div><div class="pure-g"><div class="pure-u-2-24 mb-u-1-1"></div><div class="pure-u-10-24 text-center mb-u-1-1"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet animated fadeIn wow" data-cards="hidden" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Planning to share a couple of YouTube clips this week in learning sessions.

I came away with a deeper understanding of <span class="highlight">user-driven design</span>, international localization, and the tricky technical parts of <span class="highlight">delivering websites at the scale</span> of hundreds of thousands of visitors per month.</p><p>So what were the main takeaways?</p></div><h3>Simple ideas can have tremendous value</h3><p>At its core, ViewPure seems to be just a YouTube embed player on a dedicated YouTube page. That's all. Quite literally, a middle schooler could build that. But the initial goal wasn't to "embed a YouTube video on a blank page". Rather, it was to <span class="highlight">"create a clean, distraction-free YouTube experience"</span>. The embed player was merely one component of a greater whole: the first step to realizing that goal.</p><p><span class="highlight">The aggregate of many "simple" features</span> removed enough friction points to enable use cases previously unavailable (risk-free presentation of videos in classrooms and professional settings).</p><h3>Keep things minimal</h3><p>The dominant guiding principle was to, at any point, draw the user attention to the singular, most important element on any given page. On the homepage, this meant the primary text field became the omnibox that guided users to their proper destination by inferring their intent. It meant hiding the "pro user" features such as start / end to avoid overloading the user. </p><p>On the video page, this principle is even clearer. It's all about the video. The description and video title are tucked into a hidden box, and the rest of the links on the page are relegated to secondary importance in the visual hierarchy.</p><h3>Don't overplan, don't overindex</h3><p><span class="highlight">Overindexing is a remarkably easy trap to fall into</span>: the desire to identify all possible features that users may want, to try to anticipate all the painpoints that they may face. The reality is that preempting solutions is neither clever nor effectual, and it can even lead to complex and unwieldy products.</p><p>Rather than bog down the initial version with a flurry of likely-unused features, <span class="highlgiht">I released it with the barebones essential</span>, then monitored user feedback and usage analytics to identify true painpoints and implemented features accordingly. This meant time saved on my end, and a straight-forward, no-frills experience on the users' end.</p></div></div></section><footer><div class="container"><div class="pure-g main-block"><div class="mb-u-1-1 pure-u-10-24 text-left xl-text contact-meta"><p>If you want to chat, work together, or see more of my work, drop me a line at <a href="mailto:kevin@veetri.com">kevin@veetri.com</a>.</p></div><div class="mb-u-1-1 pure-u-14-24 text-right links-meta"><ul class="social-nav animated fadeInUpSmall delay-1s"><li class="animated bounceIn delay-1s"><a class="li-btn" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevhcha/" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-linkedin-in"></i></a></li><li class="animated bounceIn delay-1s"><a class="tw-btn" href="https://twitter.com/kevhcha" target="_blank"> <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li class="animated bounceIn delay-1s"><a class="gh-btn" href="https://github.com/kevhcha" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a></li><li class="animated bounceIn delay-1s"><a class="bh-btn" href="https://www.behance.net/kevhcha" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-behance"> </i></a></li></ul><div class="timestamp">Last Updated January 12, 2019</div></div></div></div><script async="async" src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-25088811-7"></script><script>window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
